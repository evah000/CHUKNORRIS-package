# CHUKNORRIS-package
This package is a slightly modified version of the original oscillation analysis method developed by Damineli et al. (2017).
The original package GitHub page is here: https://github.com/damineli/CHUKNORRIS
The original, undisturbed package, downloaded from their github page, was compressed and named as "CHUKNORRIS-master (original)" in this repository.
Keyi Huang modified the code slightly in 2024 to make it better accommodate the need of tomato pollen tubes.

# All modifications made to the original package
These are modified to make consistent folder paths within the code & accommodate the time-lapse imaging settings
1. the folder paths
2. var1.nm and var2.nm
3. image parameters
4. tip parameters
5. src.path
